    Locale Files
   </h1>
   <p>
    Locale files in Sibyl are JSON files that store localization data. These files allow you to manage different language versions of your web pages conveniently and effectively.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Structure of Locale Files
   </h2>
   <p>
    Each locale is represented by a JSON file within the
    <code>
     locales
    </code>
    directory. The file's name corresponds to the locale's code. For instance, for an English locale, you would have an
    <code>
     en.json
    </code>
    file, and for a French locale, a
    <code>
     fr.json
    </code>
    file.
   </p>
   <p>
    A locale file is a JSON object that contains key-value pairs. The key is a string that represents the variable name, and the value is the localized string.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here's a simple example:
   </p>
   <div class="codehilite">
    <pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">"siteName"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"My Website"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">"welcomeMessage"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Welcome to my website!"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    In this example, siteName and welcomeMessage are variable names, and "My Website" and "Welcome to my website!" are the corresponding English translations.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Using Locale Variables
   </h2>
   <p>
    To use a variable from a locale file in your layouts or pages, use the double curly braces {{ }} syntax. For example, to insert the site name into a page, you would use {{ siteName }}.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Global Locale
   </h2>
   <p>
    In addition to the locale-specific files, there's a global.json file that contains variables available in all locales. If a variable is defined in both a locale file and the global file, the locale-specific value will take precedence.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Sibyl's Predefined Variables
   </h2>
   <p>
    Sibyl also provides some predefined variables for convenience, described in
    <a href="/pt/docs/variables">

    </a>
    .
