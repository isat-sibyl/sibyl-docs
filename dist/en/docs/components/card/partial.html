   <p>
    The
    <code>
     Card
    </code>
    component is a container element with a pre-defined style. It provides a way to group and present related content in a flexible and extensible container with a shadow effect to give it a 'lifting' appearance.

    General Usage Notes
   </h2>
   <ol>
    <li>
     The
     <code>
      Card
     </code>
     component comes with a box-shadow effect to create the appearance of depth. This is particularly useful for distinguishing the card from the background, especially on light-colored themes.
    </li>
    <li>
     Images placed as the first child within the card have styles applied to them to span the full width of the card.
    </li>
    <li>
     The
     <code>
      Card
     </code>
     component has a hover effect that increases its scale, giving it a 'popping' effect. This effect can be disabled by adding a class of
     <code>
      no-hover
     </code>
     to the component.
    </li>
    <li>
     The
     <code>
      Card
     </code>
     component adapts to the size of its content, with a
     <code>
      height
     </code>
     set to
     <code>
      fit-content
     </code>
     .
    </li>
    <li>
     The
     <code>
      Card
     </code>
     component is designed with a maximum width of 300px and a minimum padding of 20px.
