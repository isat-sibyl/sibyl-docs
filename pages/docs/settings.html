			# Settings

			In Sibyl, settings are stored in a file named `settings.yaml`. These settings configure the behavior of the Sibyl framework and your specific project. 

			An example `settings.yaml` could look like this:

			```yaml
			root: "/"
			default_locale: "en"
			open_browser: true
			debug: false
			max_component_nesting: 100
			components_paths: ["components", "{$SIBYL_PATH}/components"]
			layouts_paths: ["layouts", "{$SIBYL_PATH}/layouts"]
			root_folders: ["favicon"]
			pages_path: "pages"
			build_path: "dist"
			locales_path: "locales"
			static_path: "static"
			cdn_url: f"https://cdn.sibyl.dev/{version}"
			treat_warnings_as_errors: false
			dev_port: 8080
			websockets_port: 8081
			```

			In fact, these are the default settings. You can override them by creating a `settings.yaml` file in your project's root directory.
