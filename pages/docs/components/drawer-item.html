			# DrawerItem Component

			The `DrawerItem` component is used as part of the `Drawer` component to render individual items within the drawer. It supports nested items and conditional rendering for different types of items.

			## Props

			The `DrawerItem` component accepts an `item` prop which is expected to be an object (or string representing an object) with the following properties:

			| Property  | Description |
			| --------- | ----------- |
			| `id`      | A unique identifier for the item. Used to map the checkbox with its corresponding label. |
			| `icon`    | The name of the icon to be displayed for the item. |
			| `label`   | The label text to be displayed for the item. |
			| `href`    | The URL for the item to link to. If present, the item will render as an external link (`<a>` element with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noreferrer noopener"`). |
			| `page`    | The path for the item to link to within the app. If present, the item will render as a router link (`<a>` element). |
			| `children`| An array of similar objects representing sub-items. If present, the item will render as a collapsible section containing its children. |

			## Slots

			The `DrawerItem` component does not provide slots.

			## CSS Variables

			The `DrawerItem` component does not use any CSS variables.

			## Global Variables

			The `DrawerItem` component uses the following global variable:

			| Variable | Description |
			| -------- | ----------- |
			| `SIBYL_ROOT` | The root path of the app. Used when creating router links. |

			## General Usage Notes

			* The `DrawerItem` component is designed to be used within the `Drawer` component. It may not work as expected if used in isolation or in a different context.
			* The `DrawerItem` component uses recursion to render nested items. Therefore, the structure of the `item` prop can be arbitrarily deep, as long as each item follows the same structure.
			* The `DrawerItem` component includes a `DrawerItemInner` component (not shown here), which is used to render the icon and label for each item.
			* `DrawerItem` component uses the conditional rendering attributes `render-if` and `render-elif` to decide how to render each item. This is based on the presence of the `href`, `page`, or `children` properties in the `item` prop.
