			# Drawer Component

			The `Drawer` component is used for a side navigation panel, often seen in responsive design for mobile devices, or as a part of the dashboard on larger screens.

			## Props

			The `Drawer` component takes no props directly.

			## Slots

			The `Drawer` component provides a slot for custom content. `DrawerItem` components should be created within this slot.

			## CSS Variables

			The `Drawer` component uses the following CSS variables:

			| Variable | Description |
			| -------- | ----------- |
			| `--header-height` | The height of the header component. Used so the components don't overlap |
			| `--header-bg` | The background color of the header. Adopted by the drawer |
			| `--accent-secondary-transition` | The color of the transition accent on the secondary component. |

			## General Usage Notes

			* The `Drawer` component should ideally be used as a part of a larger layout or page component.
			* The `Drawer` component also includes a `DrawerItem` component, which is used internally to render each item and its children (if any). The `DrawerItem` component uses recursion to render nested items.
